a. Data Structure
-Map, Cell
 In this source code, map is consisted of cell struct.
 Cell struct has these variable
{
	--short state
	 it contain current state of cell - LIVE, DEAD, PLAGUE.
	 if it needs to change the state of itself, 
	 it set it's next state to next_prev_state,
	 and wait for next change loop code.

	--short next_prev_state
	 This variable has 2 objective - next , previous.
	 1) next - it contains next state of cell for change loop code.
	 2) previous - 
		if it change to PLAGUE state, it must save its previous state.
		so when it is in PLAGUEd, this variable save its previous state,
		and never be changed its state until PLAGUE state is over.

	--short on_devil
	 It refers how many devil are in this cell.
	 The number of devil is checked by value of this variable because devil
	 can be in same cell at a time, in devil stage.

	--bool next_devil
	 Because its code divide that of setting devil's next position and 
	 that of update on_devil value, it save tha value that existing of
	 next_devil for update loop code.
}


-Devil
 Information of devil is all on that Cell Structure, for not making devil struct.

-Angel
 Angel Struct has only 3 variables, its position.
{
	int x
	int y
	int z
}

Because its move value and scope are changed every loop, i didn't make those value to variable in angel struct.



b, c. Algorithm
-Searching and Observing
I focused this assignment for not comprehensive way. So i use linear search for almost every loop for observing map.
for same reason, i put devil object in cell structure for its similar loop code.

For Angel stage, for setting priority of moving direction, i set these directions in one array sorted by priority, get max value first, and search direction that contain max value for the first time.
