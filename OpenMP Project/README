Multicore System Assignment 4 - OpenMP Project

In first, I reused main source code of that of Pthread project for this project assignment.
And it's main stage is compressed and restructed.


A. Data Structure
Same with Pthread.
For less time consumption of Live & Dead Stage, I set 27 Circular queue for checking and modulating number of statement of adjust cell. after that, cell which has 1 or more z value check only 9 adjust cells instead of all 27 cells.


B,C. Algorithm and How reduce the time
Same Algorithm with Pthread, but there are more compression of stage.
After checking activation of function, I found 90 percents of time are consumed in Live & Dead, and Plague stage. in addition, devil and angel stage is not well affected by adding pthreads. so, I spend all Pthread to live & dead stage for reducing time of checking adjust cells.
So, Divide x range value of cube for looping of each threads, and let they loop  with their own x value range. no mutex value are used because every thread modulate value in each of own range.


Additional Algorithm
I checked that the number of thread which copy devil in last action of devil stage is only one. so, I let one thread has a mission of copying all devil instead of doing other sequence. In loop, one thread does only checking devil and copying, and other core_num - 1 threads do other sequence(devil, livedead, plague).
