A. Data Structure
For less time consumption of Live & Dead Stage, I set 27 Circular queue for checking and modulating number of statement of adjust cell. after that, cell which has 1 or more z value check only 9 adjust cells instead of all 27 cells.


B,C. Algorithm and How reduce the time
After checking activation of function, I found 90 percents of time are consumed in Live & Dead, and Plague stage. in addition, devil and angel stage is not well affected by adding pthreads. so, I spend all Pthread to live & dead stage for reducing time of checking adjust cells.
So, Divide x range value of cube for looping of each threads, and let they loop  with their own x value range. no mutex value are used because every thread modulate value in each of own range.
